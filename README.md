# ValidatesXml

Validates if a given string contains a valid xml and validates based on defined
schema too.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'validates_xml'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install validates_xml

## Usage

### Rails

If you do not want to use xsd:

```
class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  ...

  validates :content, xml: true

  ...
end
```

And if you want to use xsd, you will need to define an initializer to setup a path for your schemas:

```
ValidatesXml.setup do |configure|
  config.schema_paths = "lib/xsds"
end
```

After, you need to set your validation to specify what schema you are looking for:

```
class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  ...
  # The schema must be in lib/xsds/Schema.xsd
  validates :content, xml: { schema: 'Schema' }
  ...
end
```

***PS:*** Coming soon, I will implement a generator to create this initializer
